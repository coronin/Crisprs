Couldn't find hs37d5  (or ) NC_007605 on scaffold or chromosome or supercontig

TRYING:
/software/solexa/bin/bwa aln -n 6 -o 0 -l 20 -k 5 -N

^^^ seems to allow mismatch in the 20th position. will try with 21

Description:

Using the 'aln' function of short read aligner BWA (Li H and Durbin R, 2010) with settings for a 23bp crispr and 5 mismatches: 

bwa aln -n 5 -o 0 -l 16 -k 5 -N -R 100 <genome.fa> <crisprs.fq>

The options:
-n 5   The number of mismatches allowed in the seed
-l 23  The length of the seed (same length as a crispr, i.e. don't use a seed)
-o 0   Disable gapped alignments by setting maximum allowed gaps to 0
-k 5   Number of mismatches allowed over the entire sequence
-N     Disable iterative search to make sure all hits are found

The aligner mode of BWA produces a binary file, so to create a sam file run 'bwa samse -n 20000 <genome.fa> <output_from_aln.sai> <crisps.fq>' where n is the maximum number of alternative alignments (i.e. off-targets) to write into the sam file. The sam file produced only has a single entry per search sequence with any additional matches stored in the XA tag. Provided in BWA is xa2multi.pl which puts a each alignment onto its own line. Combined with SAMTools we can create a bed file for easier processing:
xa2multi.pl ar_align.sam | samtools view -bS - | /samtools sort - <output.sorted>
bamToBed -i <output.sorted.bam> > <output.bed>

To use BEDTools the bed file needs to be split into multiple files, with each file containing all entries for a single gene (this can be done easily with grep).

Finally:
windowBed -a ar-a.bed -b ar-a.bed -w 31
